## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. 🔑 Get Your API Key
Sign up at https://eodhd.com/ (free tier: 20 calls/day)

### 2. 🔧 Configure Environment
Edit `.env.local` and replace `your_eodhd_api_token_here` with your actual token:
```
EODHD_API_TOKEN=demo_token_here
```

### 3. 📝 Update Component Files
You still need to update two key files manually:

#### A. Update `src/components/MarketCapForm.tsx`
Replace the entire file with the enhanced component code (from the artifact I provided earlier)

#### B. Update `src/app/api/market-cap/route.ts`
Replace with the enhanced API route code

### 4. 🚀 Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000

## 🛠️ Manual File Updates Needed

Since the automated script had issues with the large React component files, please manually copy these files from my previous artifacts:

1. **Enhanced MarketCapForm.tsx** (the main component)
2. **Enhanced API route.ts** (the market cap API)

I can provide these files again if needed!
